# T-level-Fujitsu-Operation-Innovation
In this project we were approached by Fujitsu to create hardware or software for the education or health sector. My team decided to go for the education sector and more on the niche side as we went for a keyboard for the visually impaired. Our keyboard was designed with 3 models in mind. One model was the cheapest version, the keyboard which you could take with you as it was so light, but it also had braille keycaps so they could tell which key is what. Our second model was the microphone model, and as the name suggests, there was a microphone where the user could speak into the microphone and it writes whatever is said. Our last model was the speaker model, which had the microphone from the one before, and it also had a speaker which when toggled, the speaker would output the last word when pressed, and would speak the last typed letter when toggled on. Our idea was good enough that we had to create a presentation for the judges to pick the best 3 teams out of the 8 they finally decided on. Out of the original 128 teams, we came top 8 and we presented to the chief executive manager and the technological team manager and 2 other members of staff while giving off our presentation.
